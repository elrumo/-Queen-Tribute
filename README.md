# Queen Tribute

---

Once upon a time there was a young designer who dreamed of being a coder.
So he locked himself in his bedroom until he coded a website.
Every designer when we try to code.I’ve always looked at developers as if they were some sort of magicians. They can literally make a plane fly by itself and give us instant access to so much music that would take many lifetimes to listen to it all.
It’s a kind of magic I never thought myself worthy or intelligent enough to learn.
Until I started designing apps and websites.
That changed everything, I wanted to make those designs real and go beyond making something look sexy, if you’re a designers who can’t or doesn’t want to learn how to code then read on my last article on why designers who can’t code are like chefs who can’t cook.


The why
I’m currently looking for a UX design summer internship so a few months ago I decided to redesign my website portfolio and code it all by myself to start applying for jobs. I had done the design of the website, but I had no clue on what to do next to build it, I had zero coding experience.
How do I begin? Do I need a magic wand?
Like most modern stories, this one also started with a Google search, where I’ I found the magic wand I was looking for and its called freecodecamp.com, it’s a wonderful place and within a month I gained just enough knowledge to understand and begin to get a grasp of basic HTML and CSS.
I was no where near ready to code a whole website by myself let alone build my portfolio site, so what did I do next? Lock myself in my bedroom for 48 hours and not leave until I had a simple but fully operative website.
I used the free hosting service 000webhost, hence the bottom banner.I wanted to focus my attention on coding, the design wasn’t all that important, it was all about learning how to code so I limited the design stage to 1 hour only. Music has always been an inspiration to me, it’s one of the biggest parts of my life, (I even designed a music app, http://soundbitesapp.com) so I chose to make the website about the best band this world has ever seen Queen. (do. not. question. me.)
After the first 1.5h the design was done and before writing any code I code I set myself some requirements:
1. The website must be responsive AND adaptive.
2. It must contain some parallax effect.
3. It must contain some animations.
4. It must only use HTML and CSS, no Javascript for now. Let’s keep things simple.
5. Must contain some links. 
6. It must make use of the new CSS grid. (I thank God, Allah, Zeus, Ra, Thor or whoever is up there for this one amazing feature)
7. It must be linked to Google Analytics
The first step was to code the hero section, it should always fill the screen in the x and y axis with a photo. So the image must be fully responsive. The problem? I had no clue how to do that. “Let me Google it” I thought. 10 minutes later, tadah! I had a fully responsive image taking 100% of the width and height. Thanks Google! Thanks w3schools, you’re babe! 😘

Repeat that 100x times and 48h later the website is done. That was my approach, I want to make something, do I know how to? If I do, I code it. If I don’t, I google it. Easy as that.
If you’re a designer like me who wants to get into coding but has no clue how to get startet, let me share my super secretive and effective tip to you.
Just get on with it.
Simple as that, read a bit about basics of HTML and CSS, open a text editor -I use Atom- and start Googling specific shit you want to do. Please, do not spend hours upon hours reading and watching tutorial videos, just chose a project and start coding. If you’re stuck, make a quick Google search and if that doesn’t help you literally have thousands of amazing people willing to help you for free on communities such as Stack Overflow, Freecodecamp forum or Reddit.
I welcome you to join me into the exciting journey of coding. Expect to read more about how a 20 year old Industrial Design student attempts to get into coding.
On my next article I will talk about the more technical side, the actual code, what I learned during those two days and the challenges I faced.
Oh, and in case you want to review my code I’ve uploaded it to Github. :)
Happy coding!!
